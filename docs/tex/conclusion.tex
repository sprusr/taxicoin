\section{Conclusion}

The Taxicoin protocol provides a strong basis on which developers can build taxi hailing applications which can be freely extended and allow for interoperability.

As a user of an application which implements Taxicoin, riders can expect a uniform straightforward experience, where fares are decided by quotes from multiple drivers. Instead of the cost of a journey being dictated by a central authority, they receive the best possible fare available to them.

As a driver, in contrast to other taxi applications, users receive fares in their entirety. This allows them to both charge less in order to be a more compelling option to competitors, and earn more.

In the context of fairness, Taxicoin should create an environment where all parties involved cannot have conditions forced upon them, nor be cheated. The protocol specification and implementation successfully achieve this, and it is hoped that the protocol will be built upon and implemented in a variety of future applications.
